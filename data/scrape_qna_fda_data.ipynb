Some tests are used to diagnose the virus that causes COVID-19 infection whereas other tests are used to detect a recent or prior COVID-19 infection. There are 2 different types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests -- molecular tests and antigen tests. Molecular tests detect the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests detect specific proteins made by the virus. Tests that detect recent or prior COVID-19 infection are called antibody or serology tests. The EUAs allow the emergency use of tests during the COVID-19 emergency when the FDA determines certain criteria are met.

Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples. For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. Some tests can be analyzed at the point-of-care, such as in a doctor’s office or health clinic. The FDA has also authorized some at-home tests that allow a person to collect their sample and run the test completely at home without sending anything to a lab.

       "<p>A: There are two different types of tests – <strong>diagnostic tests</strong> and <strong>antibody tests</strong>.</p>\n",
       "<ol><li>A <strong>diagnostic test</strong> can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – <strong>molecular (RT-PCR)</strong> tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and <strong>antigen</strong> tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.</li>\n",
       "<li>An<strong> antibody test</strong> looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again. Samples are typically blood from a finger stick or blood draw. <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"f28ac506-aac6-42c7-802c-556897313d9e\" href=\"/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/antibody-serology-testing-covid-19-information-patients-and-consumers\" title=\"Antibody (Serology) Testing for COVID-19: Information for Patients and Consumers\">Learn more about antibody tests</a>. </li>\n",

It is suspected these animals became sick after being exposed to zoo employees with COVID-19.</p>\n",
       "<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported in minks on farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Sweden and the United States. Once the virus is introduced on a farm, spread can occur between mink as well as from mink to other animals on the farm (dogs, cats). Because some workers on these farms had COVID-19, it is likely that infected farm workers were the initial source of mink infections.</p>\n",
       "<p>Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, fruit bats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Mice, pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.</p>\n",
       "<p>For any animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a private or state laboratory, USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories performs additional testing to confirm the infection and posts the results on this page: <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/SA_One_Health/sars-cov-2-animals-us\">Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Animals in the United States</a>. </p>\n",

       "<p>A: Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.</p>\n",
       "<p>Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.</p>\n",
       "<p>Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.</p>\n",
       "<p>Other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans.

       " <p>Since the initial authorization of bamlanivimab administered alone for emergency use, there has been a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral variants across the U.S. that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone. Given the frequency of these particular viral variants, and since current testing technologies are not available to ascertain whether a particular patient who has tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infected with a viral variant prior to initiation of treatment, there is an increased risk of treatment failure when bamlanivimab is administered alone. </p>\n",
       " <p>Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the Agency concluded that the known and potential benefits of bamlanivimab administered alone no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the product. Therefore, FDA determined that the criteria for issuance of an EUA are no longer met and revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab administered alone for the treatment of COVID-19 on April 16, 2021.

Some tests are used to diagnose the virus that causes COVID-19 infection whereas other tests are used to detect a recent or prior COVID-19 infection. There are 2 different types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests -- molecular tests and antigen tests. Molecular tests detect the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests detect specific proteins made by the virus. Tests that detect recent or prior COVID-19 infection are called antibody or serology tests. The EUAs allow the emergency use of tests during the COVID-19 emergency when the FDA determines certain criteria are met. These criteria include that the test may be effective at diagnosing COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. <a href=\"/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices#IVD\">Read more about COVID-19 tests</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html\">find a community-based testing site</a>.</p>\n",

       " <p>A: Most tests to diagnose COVID-19 require a swab of your nose, or the part of the throat behind the nose, by a health care provider. Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples. For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. Some tests can be analyzed at the point-of-care, such as in a doctor’s office or health clinic. The FDA has also authorized some at-home tests that allow a person to collect their sample and run the test completely at home without sending anything to a lab. Some tests can be purchased online or in a store without a prescription, but they may not be available everywhere.

       " <p>A: There are two different types of tests – <strong>diagnostic tests</strong> and <strong>antibody tests</strong>.</p>\n",
       " <ol><li>A <strong>diagnostic test</strong> can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – <strong>molecular (RT-PCR)</strong> tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and <strong>antigen</strong> tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.</li>\n",
       " <li>An<strong> antibody test</strong> looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again. Samples are typically blood from a finger stick or blood draw. <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"f28ac506-aac6-42c7-802c-556897313d9e\" href=\"/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/antibody-serology-testing-covid-19-information-patients-and-consumers\" title=\"Antibody (Serology) Testing for COVID-19: Information for Patients and Consumers\">Learn more about antibody tests</a>. </li>\n",

Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples. For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. Some tests can be analyzed at the point-of-care, such as in a doctor’s office or health clinic. The FDA has also authorized some at-home tests that allow a person to collect their sample and run the test completely at home without sending anything to a lab. Some tests can be purchased online or in a store without a prescription, but they may not be available everywhere.

Some tests use saliva (spit) or other types of samples. For most FDA-authorized tests, the swab or sample must be sent to a lab for analysis. Some tests allow the patient to collect the sample at home and then send it to a lab for analysis. Some tests can be analyzed at the point-of-care, such as in a doctor’s office or health clinic. The FDA has also authorized some at-home tests that allow a person to collect their sample and run the test completely at home without sending anything to a lab.

       " <p>A: Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.</p>\n",
       " <p>Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.</p>\n",
       " <p>Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.</p>\n",

On November 9, 2020, FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are 12 years and older weighing at least 40kg, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.\\xa0\\nSince the initial authorization of bamlanivimab administered alone for emergency use, there has been a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 viral variants across the U.S. that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone. Given the frequency of these particular viral variants, and since current testing technologies are not available to ascertain whether a particular patient who has tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infected with a viral variant prior to initiation of treatment, there is an increased risk of treatment failure when bamlanivimab is administered alone.\\xa0\\nBased on the totality of scientific evidence available, the Agency concluded that the known and potential benefits of bamlanivimab administered alone no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the product. Therefore, FDA determined that the criteria for issuance of an EUA are no longer met and revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab administered alone for the treatment of COVID-19 on April 16, 2021.

       "    'answer': 'There are two different types of tests – diagnostic tests and antibody tests.\\nA diagnostic test can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – molecular (RT-PCR) tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.\\nAn antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again.

If your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian.\\xa0\\nAnimal testing is reserved for situations when the results may affect the treatment or management of people and animals. If your veterinarian thinks your pet is a candidate for testing, they will consult the state veterinarian and public health officials. Do not contact your state veterinarians directly: they do not have the client/patient-veterinarian relationship that would allow them to fully understand the situation and they are also actively involved in other animal disease-related emergencies as well as response to COVID-19.'},\n",
       "   {'question': 'What animal species can get COVID-19?',\n",
       "    'answer': \"We currently don’t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species. We are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs, cats and a ferret reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.\\xa0\\nLarge cats in captivity, including several lions and tigers in a New York zoo, a puma in South Africa, and tigers in a Tennessee zoo have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2,\\xa0as have several gorillas \\xa0at the San Diego zoo, after showing signs of respiratory illness. It is suspected these animals\\xa0became sick after being exposed to zoo employees with COVID-19.\\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported in minks on farms in the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Sweden and the United States. Once the virus is introduced on a farm, spread can occur between mink as well as from mink to other animals on the farm (dogs, cats). Because some workers on these farms had COVID-19, it is likely that infected farm workers were the initial source of mink infections.\\nRecent research shows that ferrets, cats, fruit bats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Mice, pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.\\nFor any animal that tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a private or state laboratory, USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories performs additional testing to confirm the infection and posts the results on this page: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Animals in the United States.\"},\n",
       "   {'question': 'Can pets carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?',\n",
       "    'answer': 'Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.\\nHowever, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste.\\nThere are no products that are FDA-approved to disinfect the hair or coats of pets, but if you do decide to bathe or wipe off your pet, first talk to your veterinarian about suitable products. Never use hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes or other industrial or surface cleaners, as these can penetrate the skin or be licked off and ingested by your pet. If you have recently used any of these products on your pet, or your pet is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian and rinse or wipe down your pet with water.'},\n",
       "   {'question': 'Are there any approved products that can prevent or treat COVID-19 in animals?',\n",
       "    'answer': 'No. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” are drugs. The FDA has not approved any drugs for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of COVID-19 in animals.\\xa0The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulates veterinary biologics, including vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other products of biological origin. Similarly, APHIS CVB has not licensed any products to treat or prevent COVID-19 in animals.\\nThe FDA has taken action against unapproved products claiming to prevent or cure COVID-19. The public can help safeguard human and animal health by reporting any products claiming to do so to FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov or 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332).'},\n",
       "   {'question': 'Is it true that animals, like dogs, cats, and cattle, get their own different types of coronavirus?',\n",
       "    'answer': 'Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.\\nDogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.\\nMost strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.\\nOther species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. More information is available in the American Veterinary Medical Association’s fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species.'},\n",
       "   {'question': 'If my pet previously had a species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get COVID-19?',\n",

       "   {'question': 'If my pet has been vaccinated for species-specific coronavirus, does that make them more or less likely to get COVID-19?',\n",
       "    'answer': 'Species-specific coronavirus vaccines are unlikely to work against this type of coronavirus because it is a new virus that is different from the species-specific strains of coronavirus targeted by the vaccine.'},\n",
       "   {'question': 'My pet has health problems and goes to the vet regularly for treatment. Should I be doing anything different to manage their health during the COVID-19 outbreak?',\n",
       "    'answer': 'While you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the COVID-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. If you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions.'},\n",
