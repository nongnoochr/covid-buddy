Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions\\xa0are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience\\xa0more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions\\xa0are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines\\xa0against COVID-19 are safe and effective.'},\n",

People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 \\xa0have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.\\nCOVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary.

When you wear a mask, you protect others as well as yourself. Masks work best when everyone wears one. A mask is NOT a substitute for social distancing.

Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\\nLearn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.'},\n",

The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe.

       "    'answer': 'Clean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces.

If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer’s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)\\n\\nFor practice resuscitation\\n\\nLimit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin.\\n\\n\\nFor actual resuscitation\\n\\nStress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Crossexternal icon), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWear a mask. Save lives.\\n\\nTeach and reinforce use of cloth masks\\xa0in public settings when around people you don’t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing.\\n\\nAdvise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they’re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCover coughs and sneezes\\n\\nTeach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.\\n\\n\\nWash hands often\\n\\nTeach and reinforce handwashing\\xa0with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\\n\\nUse hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClean and then disinfect\\n\\nCleaning with a household cleaner that contains soap or detergent reduces the amount of germs on surfaces and decreases risk of infection from surfaces. In most situations, cleaning alone removes most virus particles on surfaces. Disinfection to reduce spread of COVID-19 at home is likely not needed unless someone in your home is sick or someone with COVID-19 has been in your home within the last 24 hours.
